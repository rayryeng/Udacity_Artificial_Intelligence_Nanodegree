# Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Work
This contains my project work and optional exercises completed for the
programming portions of this nanodegree. They will be partitioned into separate directories, one for each optional exercise or project.  Please visit each
directory for more details on how to run each project and the work that
was completed.

Please note that Project #4 - Part of Speech Tagging is shared with the
Udacity Natural Language Processing nanodegree and is in fact the first
project from that nanodegree.  To view the completed project, please view the
`HMM Tagger.ipynb` file or the corresponding HTML export in `HMM Tagger.html`.
